## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
-  Receive form validation messages if:
   -  A required field has been missed
   -  The email address is not formatted correctly
-  Complete the form only using their keyboard
-  Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
-  View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
